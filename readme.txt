CSC 44800 Artificial Intelligence, Summer 2015 Project
Two node game of sprouts with minimax and genetic algorithms.

The program was written with Swift 2.0, a language used to develop iOS applications. Instructions to run:

1) Download XCode, a Swift IDE. Swift and XCode are only supported on OSx/Linux. Link: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/

2) Launch XCode and choose “Open Project”. Navigate to the “Sprouts” directory and select the “Sprouts.xcodeproj” file.

3) On the top bar, go to Product -> Run. The built in XCode iPhone simulator will launch. Select the “Sprouts” app.

For more information on the algorithms used, refer to the “Proj1Report” and “Proj2 Report” files in the “Reports” folder.
